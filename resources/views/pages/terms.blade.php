These Fees includes UbuyNG's Credits, which may be used by Service Members for various purposes as will be displayed when purchases are being made for such credits. Fees for products or services that you may wish to purchase will be made available to you before you proceed to make use of such products or services. All payments made to Ubuy are non-refundable unless otherwise stated.
                    
                    Before an Account is reinstated after fully serving the terms of its suspension due to a violation of these Terms, we may choose to Charge penalty Fees, for the expenses incurred while battling the consequences of the breach.
                    
                    By proceeding into the Platform and creating an Account, you fully agree to pay these Fees, as at when due. Fees to be paid will be subject to the conditions currently enclosed in existing Terms, and which may mandate that you dutifully pay the Fees owed even if you close you deactivate your account. All payments will be billed to your credit card or some other payment methods which we may adopt in the future. As far as all applicable law may permit, Ubuy reserves the right to by all means obtain any overdue payment and costs incurred in the recovery of such payment, especially in a case where your credit card cannot be charged. You understand and agree that any remaining balance will not be refunded to you when or if you close your Account, on the same note, you agree that UbuyNG may charge or bill you for any unpaid Fees accrued in your formerly existing account. Also, you understand and agree that with regards to payments, UbuyNG may remind you or communicate the details to you by phone calls, SMS or email, and this communication may be initiated by Ubuy or any of its representatives, or third party billing agents.

                    Ubuy maintains a position as a limited payment collection agent for Service Members, hence, by default, all Service members understand, agree and authorize us to accept payments from Customer Members on their behalf. All payments made to UbuyNG by Customer Members, as a fulfilment of their end of an agreement for a requested Pro Service will be considered by Service Members as payments made to them. Regardless of this understanding, UbuyNG does not in any way, and will not bear liabilities which may be consequent of mistakes which a Service Member may have made while delivering their part of an agreement. Furthermore, we, as Service Member's limited payment collection agent, are only obliged to a Service Member once we have received a complete payment from a Customer Member. All requests for annulment of agreements or payments and claims for refund of payments already made will be reviewed under Ubuy's sole discretion. All things being equal, and as bound by permissible laws, we will handle such requests within thirty (30) days of receiving a formally written copy of it.

                    <br><br><strong>BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER PLEASE ENSURE THAT YOU READ THIS SEGMENT CAREFULLY, AS IT ENCLOSES YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.</strong><br>
                    
                    This segment of Terms is all encompassing and is drafted with intentions that it may be broadly interpreted, as it oversees all actions that may be taken to resolve or dissolute any and all disagreement that may arise between us, without limitations to seeking rights, entitlements, claims or privileges that may arise from any interaction with us, which may be enclosed within contractual terms, statutory declarations, misrepresentation, misinterpretations, tort, fraudulent activities or any other legally binding terms, theory or activities. It addresses claims that may arise before the institution of this Agreement or prior agreements, or after the dissolution of this Agreement. The only disagreement or dispute exempted from the governance of the preceding are the legal processes involved in the affirmation of small court claims and some or specified intellectual property, as indicated below.
                    
                    By accessing and using the Platform, you understand and agree to these Terms and the use thereafter for resolving any and all disputes with UbuyNG:
                    
                    Internal/informal disagreements: Exempting the cases where a dispute may include concerns to intellectual property and small court claims. Other disputes, in specificity, most disputes can be amicably settled without the involvement of legal actions, lawsuits or any form of legal process. Parties involved may also agree to resolve such disagreements by consulting UbuyNG support department to act as a mediator between them. Otherwise, any of the party involved may initiate a lawsuit.
                    
                    Binding Arbitration: If the parties involved in a dispute were unable to settle within thirty (30) days from the time they initiated a resolution process, then any of the parties involved may initiate a legally binding arbitration as the only means for resolution, within the limits of the terms set forth below.
                    
                    With regards to any claim which may arise from interpretation of the contents and inclusions, or violation of these Terms or the Privacy Policy, user-to-user interactions, and/or user's use of the Platform shall be resolved by the final binding arbitration administered by a "Legal Team" (herein this segment: "the arbitrator" "the mediator"), for claims that do not exceed ₦5,000,000 (Five million naira).
                    
                    The Legal Team, without any interference from any federal agency, state or local agency or court, shall have the sole rights to settle all disputes or disagreements that may arise from any concerns of these Terms or the Privacy Policy, including without limitations to any claim that may imply or indicate that parts or all of these Terms or the Privacy Policy is voidable or void, even if the claim is subject to arbitration or open to being legally waived. The arbitrator exercises the authority to remedy the issue within the limits of applicable laws or in equity.
                    
                    Both parties shall be bound by a formally written tender, to make available the fees accrued due to the services provided by the Arbitrator. Furthermore, any award declared by the arbitrator shall be written and will be admissible as a judgment in any competent court. To initiate an arbitration process, you must contact the UbuyNG Support to request for contact with the Legal Team, after which you shall write a formal request (stating "Request for Arbitration") describing your claims and monetary equivalent of damages you wish to remedy. Three copies of the request shall be filed and sent to the address provided by the Arbitrator, while a copy shall be mailed to UbuyNG support. If you may involve an attorney in the arbitration process, costs incurred will by such involvement be solely borne by you.
                    
                    By going into arbitration, both parties understand and agree that the costs of arbitration could be higher than that which may be incurred through a lawsuit, and the ensuing investigations may be more limited. Nonetheless, the reverse may also be the case. Hence, any party which may be involved in the dispute should take into cognizance that they have the rights to sue in court if they so wish. In such a case that UbuyNG is involved, the case will be handled in any federal or state court in Abuja, Lagos or Port Harcourt.
                    
                    Class Action Waiver: The parties which may be involved in any dispute arising from concerns of these Terms, Privacy Policy or user interactions, by default, agree that they expressly waive their rights to file any form of, or seek, class or representative action/relief. You and UbuyNG agree that any claims which may be brought against the other will only be based in its or your capacity, and such claims shall not in any way tend towards or involve a class or representative action. If any arbitrator or court should for any reason demand that the class action waiver expressly supported by this waiver is null, void or inapplicable, or that arbitration process can resolve on a class basis, then the provisions for arbitration stated in the foregoing shall be totally declared null and void, and any arbitrary agreement so far concluded on shall be dissolved.
                    
                    Applicable exceptions: As earlier stated, intellectual property and court claims are exempted from arbitration proceedings. Hence, any of the parties involved in a dispute, despite the mutual decision to resolve their disputes through arbitration, may bring forth any enforcement actions, admissible validity forms or claims which may be related identity theft, misrepresentation, piracy, theft or unlicensed use of their intellectual property for use as judgment in any state or federal court, as permissible by the Copyright Law of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. As well, any of the parties may seek for court claims in any court relevant to the concerns of the intellectual property in question.
                    
                    30-Day Opt-out Right: Within the first thirty (30) days of your use of the Platform as a registered Member, you reserve the right to opt out from the bounds of provisions made for arbitration and class action waiver stated in the preceding. This can be done by sending a mail to hello@ubuy.ng, which its contents will include a written notice of your desire to opt out from class action waiver and arbitration.

On the same note, if you opt out within the stated period, you and UbuyNG shall not be bound by the terms stated in this segment of these Terms.

The amended Terms become effective thirty (30) days after they are posted on the Platform or sent to your email account.
                    
                    Any change made to this segment will be applicable after the thirty (30) days notification period. If for any reason, an arbitrator/mediator or court demands that the terms of "Changes to This Segment" be referred to as void, or is not applicable, then all the terms therein will be nullified from the limits of "Binding Arbitration" and "Class Action Waiver." Hence, the court or arbitrator shall make use of the terms of "Binding Arbitration" and "Class Action Waiver" parts of the segment, which were in existence after you started using the Platform.
                    
                    Validity: The terms included in "Binding Arbitration" and "Class Action Waiver" will remain valid beyond the existence of the Platform or your Account.
